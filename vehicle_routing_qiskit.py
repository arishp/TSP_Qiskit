# formalize an idealized version of the problem and showcase its solution using
# the quantum approximate optimization approach of Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann (2014)
# The overall workflow we demonstrate comprises:
# # We generate client locations randomly.
# # We consider the Euclidean distance, “as the crow flies”, for pair-wise distances or time computations.
# # compute the actual routes twice. First, by classical solver (IBM CPLEX). Second, hybrid algorithm partly on the QC.
# # visualization of the results is a simplistic plot.
